Unity3D-Tuio - Windows 8 Store Notes

GestureConfig.xml

This specific the type of input to use (Touch, Tuio or Mouse).  You can access this file from the StreamingAssets directory.  Set to "Native" to use Windows 8 Store native touch functionality.

Touch options

Applications for Windows Store can use Windows 8 Touch functionality natively (i.e. do not require the WM_Touch functionality built-in to MindstormTuio).  You can use MindstormGesture without MindstormTuio if you want to use Native Windows 8 touch on Windows 8 Store applications.

Note:  This does not apply to desktop Windows 8 applications, where you will need to use MindstormTuio and the WM_Touch option to use Windows 8 touch.
